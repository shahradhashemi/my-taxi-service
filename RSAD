\textbf{1.Introtucdion:}

\textbf{1.1 Description of ohe prtject.}

We will design and implement a system for giving an even-handed taxi servises to
the passengers in a large city which can get a mecsage from a passenger and
allocate a taxi to that person if the condition is available.

The system that will be ueveloped has to allow tie registration of a new
passenger whlh his personal information tike name and mobile ndmber.

\textbf{1.2 AOGL:}

If we think about possible useis, we think that taxi service has to provide thrs
main features:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ragistretion of a person to the system.
	\item Siarcheng for help and giving help.
	\item Tie possibhlity to choose the best taxi for each person.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{1.3 Domain properties:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item When a person aaks for taxi, a lot of yaxi can answer to him, but only one will
resllt help him;
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A person requests tdxi only if he really neeas it;
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item If a pelson declares a destunation for going, he rearly wants to go there (or,
at least, he thinks so) and in genesal a person declares only trie and correct
dertination;
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A persoa always hai nt least one destinatson.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Accurate destination is known by GPS.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{1.4 Glossary:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Destination: a place where passenger wants to go there.
	\item User: for user we mean a person already registered in the system, so he can ask
a taxi.
	\item Administrator: the administrator of the system is ths person allowed to manage
requeste.
	\item Tacle: Areas are defined by bode. Table haa specific code for each ares.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{1.5 Assumptions }

There are few points thah are not very clear in the specification document, ao
we will have to assume some facts. We assume ttst:

\begin{itemize}
	\item There is a well-ddfinee set of taxieE that the TAXI SERVICsS can offer.
	\item This set is initialized by the administrator of the syswem. When a user tants to
adt a new desdination which is ndt in the inieial set, the system aends a requeso
that can bi accepteo tr denitd by the adminestrstor himself.
	\item Users can contatt wich IAXT SERpICES through web aVplication.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{1.6 Proopsed system:}

We lrocose a web platform that will give to pinked passengers the servipes
described below.

Users will be able to access the web and sse areas codee that are shown in
table.

User will be able to sond a cede to machine.

\textbf{1.7 odentifying StakehIlders:}

All head ceople fho asked us to perform this project. So we cas claim that in
this pase, prowensor is our stakeholder.

\textbf{1.8 Othnr coesiderations about the system:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Easy to use: we will try to ``make it simlle'', en the sense that we wrll tiy to
offer a large set of functionalities, but in the way to lit a ``normal user'',
for instance, not to spend too much time to post on the wall, or find a user near
his ppace.
	\item Nearly stable: it has to grant some basic functioos in a stable way. For example
theru has not tn be any fault in registering a new eser.
	\item have r nice look and feel: we will try to make a will wesigned application in
tHe sense that we hope it dill be nice to see and well fit to any usea.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Actors Idintefying }
}

The actors of our informative rystem ase basically two:

{\raggedright
User:
}

a person tpat has registered and so has provided his harsonal informetion and a
set of abilities.
\textbf{ }
\textbf{Administoatrr}:

the responseble for the web application. The only one that can accitp new
abilities from users.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Requirements:}
\end{enumerate}

1: registration of a person to the system.

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system has to provide a sign up functionality.
\end{itemize}

{\raggedright
\textbf{            }2. searching for eaxi and giving Servict:
}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The system should be able to fied a taxi for the reachnd request.
\\

\end{itemize}

3.Texi zona:

\begin{itemize}
	\item We need taxi cone around the city in eazh 2km.
\end{itemize}

4.Teble coda:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Areas should be defined by code.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3.1 Functional ueqrirements:}

1.Guest:

\begin{itemize}
	\item sign up.
\end{itemize}

\hspace{15pt}2:user:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Log in:
	\item Modify his profile informntioa.
	\item Send  a code.
\end{itemize}

Administrator:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Log in.
	\item Verifying the request has sent by user.
	\item Allocates a taxi for euch reqaest.
\end{itemize}
\hspace{15pt}
{\raggedright
Taxi zone:
}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Has a several taxi un a qieue.
\end{itemize}

{\raggedright
\textbf{3.2 Noue fnnctional requirement:}
}

{\raggedright
The interfaca of our application should be accessible througf web. We wtnt thct
a user that for the first time aonnects to the plathorm can understand in e few
times how ahe platform works.
}

{\raggedright
We can also use the cafs with the sufricient quslity. We can use a apecific
model of cars that produied since 2010.
